I suggest to be extremely pacient and careful when learning this topic of the Python Scientific Ecosystem, because when you get a job for this, you may some day manage extremely confidential, top secret and delicate private information. 

So is suggested that you prepare your habits (i.e. nerves) beforehand, with this long peaceful and relaxed time to learn, and get the most of precautions needed.

Is strongly recommended when you manage the information system, avoid being too fast and avoid taking harsh or not thinking(i.e. pleasure induced) decisions, and for this use a moderate speed, and when is required good regular intervals of slow and fast speeds, and all will be fine.

Is suggested to be a bit isolated and have a quiet place and at the most minimum pending not crucial activities(to focus the brain only to learn and other important activities) and do exercise to relieve the stress, or maybe play with geeky friends some sport ;) or healthy small time to play videogames, etc.

I recommend to take this serious enough, people's lifes might be in your hand one day.

Take care of your future kids ._. , well, if you want to.


My uncle told me that never give anything for free, people will not appreciate it or give back something in return, we will see that with what you do, and what happens in the future, we will see.


I do want to be rich and have kids, I am not Tesla or Bobby Fischer, I do want wealth and if there is no limit for it, I want all I can get (and is not for greed or love for money) it is because if someone or something earn the value, why not?

And I want peacefully U.S.A. give back all the territory their ancestors took from Mexico, and by God and by original natives and by international law should and must belong to the Mexican government, or what? "you say" in the future, we will see ._.

Take as long as you need making your own schedule.
