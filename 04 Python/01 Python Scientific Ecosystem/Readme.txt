I suggest to be extremely pacient and careful when learning this topic of the Python Scientific Ecosystem, because when you get a job for this, you may some day manage extremely confidential, top secret and delicate private information. 

So is suggested that you prepare your habits (i.e. nerves) beforehand, with this long peaceful and relaxed time to learn, and get the most of precautions needed.

Is strongly recommended when you manage the information system, avoid being too fast and avoid taking harsh or not thinking(i.e. pleasure induced) decisions, and for this use a moderate speed, and when is required good regular intervals of slow and fast speeds, and all will be fine.

Is suggested to be a bit isolated and have a quiet place and the most minimum pending not crucial activities(to focus the brain only to learn and other important activities) and do exercise to relieve the stress, or maybe play with geeky friends some sport ;) or healthy small time to play videogames, etc.

I recommend to take this serious enough, people's lifes might be in your hand one day.

Take as long as you need making your own schedule, to learn all you need, in a good relaxing calmness.
