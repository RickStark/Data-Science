This is a matter of your perspective and choice to learn with the quick path or the slower path, as always I suggest the slowest path or a mix of both, but if is outmost required, just with the quick path to learn Machine Learning is ok.

The best of all of this directory is that, if you take a mix of the quick path and slow path or preferably the slow path, is unbelievably easy, fast and free, although comes with the cost of thinking on following me ;) to gather even more money and invest it, than we will earn, maybe indefinitely money ;).

Check by reading some basic books how much time will it take you approximately to read the next book in order to make your own schedule to learn all you need.
