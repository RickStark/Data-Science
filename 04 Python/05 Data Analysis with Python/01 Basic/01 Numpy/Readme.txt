You will need to start with some Basic Linear Algebra books for a bit of theory, but when you begin to practice, all will be easier.

Smiling a bit for this? ;)

I suggest that while learning this, when you are eating, see the videotutorials of Linear Algebra and/or Numpy for better learning.

With adding 3 or 2 books of theory of Linear Algebra of your liking, max to learn it all 19 days.
