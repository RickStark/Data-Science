If even with the best organization of companies and code and ultimate technology and resources the debt instead of reducing is increasing, 
is it humanly healthy that people recognize and be always with a tiny remainder that your country is in great debt or will always be?

I am not talking about ecominics, is just about the position the world economy puts the human to have that tiny fly always bothering instead of helping.
