The suggestions of the C++ books are of my tiny knowledge of the subject, in fact I despise C++,
so I suggest you use your own order of the compilation of books you download and check everyone which is easier,
I selected the Tony Gaddis book, because I liked a lot that goes step by step and good colors of the book.
