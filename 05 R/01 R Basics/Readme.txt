I suggest the longer learning path, or when you feel you are ready when you finish some books of the longer learning path, use the quick learning path.

If some parts of the quick learning path are difficult to understand, use the longer learning path and continue the quick learning path as you need. 

I suggest to use the books that have the code already in the website and/or copy the code of the books that are easier to understand.

After this level of Basics, is easier to understand the cookbooks and advanced topics, I think.

I have not checked the code or test any of this, however is a good and easier path, at least for me, to understand R and then the most advanced topics.
