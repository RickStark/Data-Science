Check books with this chapter Design and Analysis of Experiments and Observational Studies

Here you learn well how to do time series

With these books you do not learn how to use excel basic functions, so most business statistical professionals maybe do not know so much excel of they did not learn data analysis or excel

I suggest just take 31 days to learn all you can, although max 40 days to learn it all.

Again when eating, see the videotutorials.

For the time of "Books for exercises", max 22 days to learn it all.
