# A Data Science course

All code organized.

Si vis fidelia absolutus, learn it, est is divitiae maxima, just remember and do omnia in mensura et numero et pondere disposuisti.

The understanding of the themes will be more clear as you progress into the next book which will become easier to understand than the previous one.

This plan is organized so you can exercise at least 1 hour a day, eat healthy food, sleep well, use non-fluoride products, have a clean environment and rest at least 1 day each week to remember more everything.

At the last 3 topics of the course, you might need 2 hours to exercise a day, for better wellness.

Any help to mantain and contribute to this project will be appreciated and acknowledged(if you want to). 

This compilation is made also for those special people that are in our lives, they do not really need money, they always need care, specially truthful love and protection.

I thank the next authors who with his books is achieved this compilation:
